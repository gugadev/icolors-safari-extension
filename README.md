## How to run

Clone this repository and open it with Xcode. Press the play button to run the project.

Go to "Develop" menu (learn how to enable it [here](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/safari/sfri20948/mac)) and enable the option _"Allow unsigned extensions"_. If you're using Safari 17, press `âŒ˜` and `,` then press the _Developer_ tab; you will find the "Allow unsigned options" there.

Finally, press the iColors logo and choose "Allow the access for every site". You'll need to do this just once.

Enjoy!
